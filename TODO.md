# Aether Build — TODO

## SDK function configuration

Today every SDK function takes just the context — zero config, pure convention:

```aether
build.javac(b)
build.kotlinc(b)
build.go_build(b, "c-shared", "libgonasal.so")
```

Three levels of configuration, progressively more expressive:

### Level 1: Zero config (done)

Convention handles standard layouts. No args needed.

```aether
build.javac(b)
```

### Level 2: Named args

Common overrides as named parameters. No trailing block needed.

```aether
build.javac(b, source: "17", target: "17")
build.kotlinc(b, jvm_target: "17")
build.go_build(b, mode: "c-shared", output: "libgonasal.so")
build.cargo_build(b, lib: "libvowelbase.so", profile: "release")
build.shade(b, main_class: "com.example.Main", output: "app.jar")
```

### Level 3: Trailing block DSL

Full control via Aether's `_ctx` invisible context injection — the same
mechanism as `sandbox() { grant_fs_read(...) }`.

```aether
build.javac(b) {
    source_version("17")
    target_version("17")
    annotation_processor("lombok")
    extra_flags("-Xlint:all", "-Werror")
    encoding("UTF-8")
}

build.kotlinc(b) {
    jvm_target("17")
    api_version("1.9")
    extra_flags("-Werror")
}

build.go_build(b) {
    mode("c-shared")
    output("libgonasal.so")
    flags("-ldflags", "-s -w")
    env("CGO_ENABLED", "1")
    tags("netgo")
}

build.cargo_build(b) {
    lib("libvowelbase.so")
    features("jni", "serde")
    profile("release")
    extra_flags("--jobs", "4")
}

build.tsc(b) {
    strict(true)
    target("ES2022")
    module_kind("NodeNext")
}

build.junit(b) {
    includes("**/*Tests.class")
    excludes("**/*IntegrationTests.class")
    jvm_args("-Xmx2g", "-ea")
    parallel(true)
    timeout(300)
}

build.mocha(b) {
    timeout(5000)
    reporter("spec")
    grep("unit")
}

build.shade(b) {
    main_class("com.example.Main")
    output("app.jar")
    exclude("META-INF/*.SF", "META-INF/*.DSA")
    relocate("com.google.common", "shaded.guava")
}
```

Each setter stores config in the `_ctx` map. The SDK function reads
the map after the block runs and translates to compiler flags.

### Implementation plan

1. Named args first — add optional parameters to existing SDK functions.
   `javac(ctx, source, target)` with defaults. Quick, no language changes.
2. Trailing block second — requires the SDK function to accept a block,
   run it to populate a config map, then use the config. Uses Aether's
   existing builder DSL + `_ctx` injection.
3. Each config setter is a function with `_ctx: ptr` as first param
   (invisible injection): `source_version(_ctx: ptr, ver: string)`.

## Runner improvements

### Target filtering (done)

`aeb <target>` builds only the named target and its transitive deps.

```bash
aeb java/applications/monorepos_rule          # just this + deps
aeb javatests/components/vowelbase            # auto-detects test
aeb --dist java/applications/monorepos_rule   # compile + package
```

### ~~`scan()` grammar function — glob-based dep discovery~~ (done)

`build.scan(b, "<glob>")` lives in lib/build/module.ae. Static
extraction is wired in tools/extract-deps.ae (alongside the
existing dep() needle). The runtime side calls fs.glob and
forwards each match through dep() so cargo/npm/maven
classification works transparently. Tests in
tests/test_extract_deps_scan.ae (6 assertions, fixture-tree
based — first one of its kind alongside test_aether_resolvers).
README documents it under "Affected-target detection" as the
declarative complement to `--pattern`.

What's NOT implemented from the original sketch:
- **`.aebignore` respect**: scan() expansion currently ignores
  the same .aebignore file that scan-ae-files reads. Low priority
  — most users want their tests/builds/dists picked up regardless
  of the global ignore list, and scan patterns are explicit
  enough that the user's intent is clear. Revisit if a real
  porter hits the gap.
- **Multi-pattern scan() in one call**: today's signature is
  one pattern per call. Users compose by writing N scan() lines.
  Could add `scan_all(b, "p1", "p2", ...)` if a real consumer
  needs it; not asked for yet.

### Parallel execution

Independent modules in the DAG can build concurrently. The visited map
needs thread-safe access (mutex or atomic). Aether actors are a natural
fit — one actor per module, message-passing for completion.

### ~~Affected-target detection~~ (done)

Shipped via `aeb --since <ref>` and `aeb --print-affected <ref>`.
Walks reverse-dep edges from changed-file owning targets. Source-
to-target ownership rule: nearest enclosing directory with a
dot-prefixed `.ae` build file. Multiple build files in one dir
all share ownership of source files in that dir (the round-218
multi-binary case).

Useful CI shape: `aeb --since main` (or `--since origin/main`)
runs only the targets affected by the PR's changes. Telemetry
shows what built; cache integration ensures hits stay hits even
when the broader CI pipeline rebuilds something else.

**TODO: `--since` is Git-only today.** The changed-files list comes
from a hard-coded `git diff --name-only <ref>` shell-out in
`tools/aeb-main.ae` (~line 489). Only that one step is VCS-specific
— everything downstream (owning-target resolution, reverse-dep DAG
walk, `--pattern` / `--shard` narrowing) is VCS-agnostic and works
off a plain changed-paths list. Other VCS could be added by
detecting the repo type and swapping the diff command:
`hg status --rev <ref>` / `jj diff --name-only` / `svn diff
--summarize`, etc. The clean shape is a small `_changed_files(ref)`
helper that picks the command by repo type (probe for `.git` /
`.hg` / `.jj` / `.svn`), feeding the same `_changed.txt` the
affected-targets tool already consumes — no change to the walk.

### Local content-addressed cache (partially done)

`lib/cache/` ships sha256+zlib content-addressable storage under
`$AEB_CACHE_DIR` (default `~/.aeb/cache`). Wired into:
- `lib/maven` — resolved classpath
- `lib/aether` — manual-path link binary
- `lib/java` — javac + javac_test classes trees (tar+zlib)

Other SDKs still use mtime-only (or no skip at all). Remaining wiring,
roughly in order of expected wall-time savings:

- `lib/kotlin` (kotlinc — closest in shape to lib/java)
- `lib/scala` (scalac — same shape)
- `lib/ts` (tsc)
- `lib/dotnet` (dotnet build)
- `lib/go` (go build — `go` already has its own cache; aeb wrap value lower)
- `lib/rust` (cargo — cargo already has its own cache; aeb wrap value lower)
- `lib/clojure`, `lib/python` (lower priority)

Each SDK's cache wiring is the same shape: hash inputs (sources +
classpath + flags + toolchain version) → probe `cache.get` →
restore artifact on hit, run on miss → `cache.put`. See `lib/aether`
and `lib/java` for the reference implementations.

### Remote build cache

The next layer up from local caching: share artifacts across
machines (Bazel, Gradle, Nx, Turborepo all do this). Implementation:
hash inputs → check remote store (S3, GCS, local server) → download
artifacts or build locally → upload result. The cache primitives in
`lib/cache/` are the substrate; needs a backend protocol and auth.

#### Content-Defined Chunking (CDC) — a later layer, but it shapes the format now

Prior art: BuildBuddy's "Remote Cache CDC: Reusing Bytes" (May 2026)
— Bazel 8.7 / 9.1+ `--experimental_remote_cache_chunking`. The idea:
don't cache a large output as one indivisible blob. Run a rolling
hash over it (FastCDC), cut at content-defined boundaries, store each
chunk as its own content-addressed entry plus a small reconstruction
record keyed by the whole-blob digest. A small source change then
re-transfers/-stores only the chunk(s) it perturbed. BuildBuddy
reports ~85% byte dedup on chunk-eligible writes (blobs > 2 MiB;
20–40% across all traffic). Read/write split: `SplitBlob` (fetch the
chunk layout, pull only missing chunks) / `SpliceBlob` (push missing
chunks + the reconstruction record).

Why it matters for aeb specifically:

- **It is the byte-level partner of the `c889f25` import-closure
  key.** That key (correctly) busts every consumer's cache entry
  when a widely-imported module changes — so a `repo_storage`-shaped
  edit re-caches N near-identical consumer binaries. Correct
  invalidation + CDC = consumers still rebuild, but the restoring
  near-identical artifacts cost only their changed chunks. The
  big-transitive-output actions CDC targets (linking, packaging) are
  exactly aeb's `aether.program`, `java.shade`, driver-test binaries,
  container images.

- **One design constraint binds NOW, before any CDC work: chunk the
  *uncompressed* bytes.** CDC needs byte-level similarity across
  revisions; a compressed stream loses it — a small input change
  rewrites much of a `.gz`. aeb's `lib/cache` is sha256 **+ zlib**
  whole-blob, and `lib/java` caches the classes-tree as **tar+zlib**.
  Compress-then-store is the CDC anti-pattern. If CDC is ever wanted,
  the cache format must be chunk-first, then compress per chunk (or
  not at all) — never chunk a `.tar.gz`. Worth keeping the door open
  even though CDC itself is far off.

Sequencing: CDC is a *layer on* the remote cache, not step 1. Order
is (a) remote CAS + backend protocol + auth, (b) CDC on top —
`lib/cache` is already a local content-addressed store, so chunks
slot in as ordinary CAS entries. Honest status: aeb is ~6 months in;
remote cache itself is unstarted. CDC is recorded here as prior art
and as the one constraint (uncompressed chunking) that affects cache
format decisions made before then.

### ~~Build graph visualization~~ (done)

Shipped in commit `be2d97c`. `aeb --graph` (DOT default) /
`aeb --graph mermaid` for inline-Markdown output. Pipe DOT to
`dot -Tsvg` or paste Mermaid into a `\`\`\`mermaid` fence.

### ~~Watch mode~~ (done)

Shipped via `aeb --watch [target]`. Watches source dirs derived
from the current edges file (sparse-checkout-aware: only dirs
that exist on disk get watched, so gcheckout co-existence is
clean). Linux uses inotifywait; macOS uses fswatch. Change
events flow through `--changed-paths-from` → affected-targets →
narrowed rebuild. Debounce: 200ms.

Composes with everything that just shipped: cache makes warm
rebuilds fast, telemetry shows `[hit]`/`[miss]`/`<P>/<T> PASS|FAIL`
per target, the affected-target walk skips unchanged targets.

What might be follow-up:

- **Sparse-checkout dynamism**: today the watch list is computed
  once at start. If `aeb gcheckout add foo` materialises new dirs
  while a watch is running, those new dirs aren't picked up until
  the user restarts the watch. Tracked: detect changes to
  `.git/info/sparse-checkout` and rebuild the watch list.
- **Per-target dirs vs per-source patterns**: today a recursive
  watch on each target's dir catches all changes. Some SDKs (Java
  with `source_layout("maven idiomatic")`) might want narrower
  scopes (`src/main/java/**` only, not `target/**` or `node_modules/**`).
  Today's exclude list (`target`, `.aeb`, `.git`) covers the
  common feedback loops; add more as needed.

### User-defined builders

Currently all builders live in `lib/*/module.ae` shipped with aeb.
Users should be able to define project-local builders in their own
`.ae` files without forking the SDK. A `local_lib/` directory
alongside `.aeb/lib/` that the compiler searches first.

### Lockfiles for reproducible dep resolution

Maven/NuGet/npm versions can shift between builds (ranges, snapshots,
latest). A `dep.lock` file recording exact resolved versions ensures
reproducible builds. The resolver already computes the full closure —
just needs to write it out and check it on subsequent runs.

### Build telemetry (partially done)

Per-module wall-time + cache outcome rendered as a `[telemetry]`
block at the end of every build. The orchestrator (generated by
`tools/gen-orchestrator.ae`) records (label, type, wall_ms, cache)
per module into an in-memory list and hands it to
`build.render_telemetry` for the stdout renderer.

Cache outcomes wired in three SDKs (`lib/aether`, `lib/java`,
`lib/maven` indirectly via java); other SDKs report `n/a`.

Test-result outcomes (per-target pass/fail counts) wired across
all test builders:
- `bash.test` — exact counts (already tracked internally)
- `java.junit5` — parses `[N tests successful]` / `[N tests failed]`
- `java.junit` — parses `OK (N tests)` / `Tests run: N, Failures: F`
- `jest.test` — parses `N passed, M failed` from summary line
- `python.pytest` — parses `N passed, M failed` and `N error`
- `dotnet.test` — parses `Passed: N, Failed: M`
- `aether.program_test`, `go.go_test`, `rust.test`,
  `rust.test_workspace`, `kotlin.kotlin_test`, `clojure.test`,
  `scala.munit`, `ts.mocha` — coarse 1/1 success or 0/1 failure
  (per-test count parsing is a follow-up per SDK as consumers
  ask for it)

The `[telemetry]` block now shows test rows with a
`<passed>/<total> PASS|FAIL` trailer alongside the existing
`[cache]` annotation: `test: foo  3.03s [n/a] 17/17 PASS` or
`test: bar  5.40s [hit] 28/30 FAIL`.

What's left:

- **More cache integration → better telemetry**: each SDK that
  grows `cache.get`/`cache.put` integration also gets honest
  `[hit]`/`[miss]` reporting in telemetry for free.
- **Alternative renderers**: file dump (JSON, JSON Lines) for CI
  consumption; HTML/JS for a richer view (force-directed graph
  with node sizes by wall-time, colors by cache outcome). The
  records list is the single source of truth; renderers walk
  it without modifying.
- **Cross-build aggregation**: "what's our cache hit rate over
  the last 100 builds?" Needs persistent storage (per-build
  telemetry file under `target/_aeb/` or central `~/.aeb/log/`).
  Postpone until a real consumer asks.
- **Per-builder timing inside an SDK**: today telemetry sees
  per-target wall-time. Inside `aether.program(b)`, regen vs
  aetherc vs gcc isn't separated. Useful for SDK profiling;
  needs each SDK to emit phase markers. Defer.

#### Telemetry — the four-tier vision

Today's implementation is the degenerate case of a much larger
shape. As aeb grows parallel module execution, multi-process
worker fan-out, and remote build, the telemetry channel evolves
through four tiers. Each tier is its own session of work; the
*data model* is forward-compatible across all four (records can
gain fields without breaking renderers), but the *transport*
between informer and consumer must change at each step.

A node informs the graph "I started" and later "I ended,
extra-info...", with arbitrary other informers writing
interleaved between. The data model captures that explicitly
with two-sided events:

```
{ kind: "start", label: "ae/myserver:seed", at_ns: ..., type: "build" }
{ kind: "end",   label: "ae/myserver:seed", at_ns: ..., cache: "hit", ... }
```

The current "records" shape (one map per completed module) is
the synchronous fold of those events: start arrived → in-progress,
end arrived → record completed. When transport stays single-
process synchronous, folding can happen at append time and the
events are never materialised (today's case).

##### Tier 0 — single process, synchronous (DONE)

In-memory list, records appended as each module finishes, lost
on exit. The orchestrator (one process) is the only writer. No
synchronization needed. What this commit ships.

##### Tier 1 — single process, multi-thread

Triggered when aeb grows parallel module execution (already on
the TODO under "Parallel execution"). Multiple worker
threads/actors build independent DAG branches concurrently.

Transport: a `TelemetryActor` owns the records list. Workers
`send Started{label,...}` / `send Ended{label, cache, ...}`.
No locks; message-passing is the synchronization. Aether's
actor model is the natural fit.

Inflection point: the records→events refactor lands here. The
TelemetryActor's mailbox IS the event stream; it folds events
into records as messages arrive, hands the records to the
existing `render_telemetry` at session end. Renderer signature
unchanged.

`clock_ns()` is monotonic and meaningful between threads on the
same host (sub-microsecond drift). Wall-time semantics survive.

##### Tier 2 — multi process, same machine

Triggered when aeb spawns subprocess workers (e.g. parallel
`aetherc`/`javac`/`gcc` invocations from `tools/aeb-link.ae`,
or per-target subprocess fan-out). All workers share the
filesystem and the wall clock.

Transport: append-only file log at `target/_aeb/telemetry.jsonl`.
Each subprocess opens the file in `O_APPEND` and writes one
event per line. POSIX guarantees writes ≤ PIPE_BUF (4096 bytes
on Linux, 512 minimal POSIX) are atomic against concurrent
writers; events fit comfortably. No locks, no coordination.
Standard practice — Bazel BES, Buck2, Nx Cloud all use
append-only logs.

Workers find the log via env var (`AEB_TELEMETRY_LOG=...`)
inherited from the orchestrator. The orchestrator reads the
log post-build, folds events to records, hands to the renderer.

`clock_ns()` is monotonic per-process. Cross-process timing is
accurate to ~microseconds (different processes have their own
monotonic baselines). For "what's slow?" this doesn't matter.

##### Tier 3 — multi machine / VM / container

Triggered when aeb grows remote build execution. Workers run
on different hosts. No shared filesystem, no shared clock.

Transport: a network-reachable telemetry sink. Industry
standard is Bazel's Build Event Stream (BES) — gRPC streaming
of protobuf events, well-defined semantics for incomplete
builds, reusable consumers (BuildBuddy, EngFlow). Don't roll
own; adopt BES when the time comes.

Each event gains identity discriminators: `host`, `pid`, `tid`,
container/VM ID. The records→events refactor from Tier 1 means
adding fields is a no-op for renderers (they ignore unknown
keys).

Clock skew is real: cross-host timing requires either NTP-bound
wall-clock with accepted skew, or logical clocks (Lamport,
vector). Per-host monotonic order is preserved; cross-host
causal ordering is the harder problem. BES sidesteps by
standardising on UTC wall-clock with skew tolerance.

Backpressure: if the sink is slow or unreachable, workers can't
block on inform. Local buffer + async flush + drop-on-overflow
counter (Bazel's pattern).

##### Forward-compatibility checklist

The current Tier 0 implementation should not lock decisions
that constrain Tiers 1-3. Status:

- ✓ Records are `map<string, string>` (open-ended; can grow
  fields like `host`, `pid`, `cache`, `exit_code` without
  changing the renderer signature).
- ✓ Renderer takes a list and a total — same shape as
  events-folded-to-records will produce in Tier 1+.
- ✓ Cache markers are per-target files, readable across
  process boundaries — already Tier 2 compatible (a worker
  subprocess writing the marker is observable to the
  orchestrator parent).
- ✗ The events shape is not yet a thing. Tier 1's records→
  events refactor IS the event-protocol introduction. ~50
  LOC of orchestrator + actor + renderer; defer until the
  parallel-modules feature drives it.

##### Where each tier's preconditions live

| Tier | Blocked on | Estimated session work |
|---|---|---|
| 0 → 1 | Parallel module execution (TODO above) | ~half-session, riding the parallel-modules feature |
| 1 → 2 | Subprocess fan-out in aeb-link or per-SDK | ~half-session, tied to whichever feature spawns subprocesses |
| 2 → 3 | Remote build execution + BES adoption | Multi-session; the telemetry transport piece is the smaller part |

### Code coverage — per-language SDK wiring

Today `aeb --coverage` is a cross-cutting CLI flag (set as
`AEB_COVERAGE=1` env by the trampoline, every SDK reads it if it
knows what to do). Wired in `lib/aether/` only:

- shell-out path: appends `--coverage` to `ae build` (Aether
  0.115 feature; injects `gcc --coverage` and forces `-O0 -g`)
- manual path: swaps `-O2` for `-O0 -g --coverage` in the gcc
  command emitted by `aether_link_cmd`
- cache key segregates coverage from non-coverage builds

Each non-aether language has its own native coverage flow —
none yet wired to honor the aeb-side flag. Per-SDK follow-up:

- **java.junit5 / java.junit**: JaCoCo. Add `-javaagent:jacocoagent.jar=destfile=target/<mod>/jacoco.exec`
  to the JVM args. User runs `java -jar jacococli.jar report ...`
  to render. Bounded — one javaagent flag, one extra classpath
  download or maven coordinate for the agent jar.
- **jest.test**: `jest --coverage`. One flag.
- **python.pytest**: `pytest --cov=<src>`. Or wrap with `coverage run -m pytest`.
- **dotnet.test**: `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`.
  Drops .coverage files; `reportgenerator` renders.
- **go.go_test**: `go test -coverprofile=target/<mod>/cover.out`.
  Built-in.
- **rust.test / rust.test_workspace**: `RUSTFLAGS="-C instrument-coverage"`
  + `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE=...` env vars, or `cargo-llvm-cov` if
  installed. Per-rustc-version variation.
- **scala.munit**: scoverage compiler plugin. Different shape.
- **kotlin.kotlin_test**: usually JaCoCo (JVM-shared).
- **clojure.test**: cloverage.
- **ts.mocha**: nyc / c8.

Cross-cutting render: aeb does not render; users delegate to
gcovr/lcov/jacococli/reportgenerator/etc. per language.

### Cross-compilation targets

Building for a different OS/arch than the host. Relevant for Go
(`GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64`), Rust (`--target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`),
.NET (`-r linux-arm64`). DSL: `target_platform("linux-arm64")`.

### Hermetic dependency pinning

aeb currently trusts whatever version the resolver returns. For
production builds, pin every transitive dep to an exact version with
integrity hashes (like `package-lock.json` or `go.sum`). Detect drift
between lock file and resolved deps.

## Aether compiler issues to fix upstream

- [x] **0.146 regression: `string.substring` return aliased + outer
      reassign-to-`""` corrupts the alias.** Fixed in 0.147.0
      (ownership-transfer logic at the reassignment-wrapper, see
      `../aether/CHANGELOG.md` § [0.147.0]). Cleared three of the
      four downstream failures (`test_brew`, `test_telemetry_render`,
      `test_affected_targets`).
- [x] **0.147 regression: `list.add` of a heap-string alias doesn't
      count as escape.** Fixed upstream — 0.149.0 cleared the
      escaped-LHS-alias source flag, and 0.151.0 replaced that with a
      full ownership transfer (heap flag moves on alias). See
      `../aether/CHANGELOG.md` §§ [0.149.0] (Regression A) and
      [0.151.0]. `test_java_cache` passes on 0.161.0; the defensive
      `string.concat(x, "")` copies in `tools/gcheckout.ae`'s
      dep-walk loop were removed (verified with a dep-chain run).
- [x] **0.147 regression: tuple-destructure reassign of a
      string-interp variable double-frees at function exit.** Fixed
      upstream in 0.149.0 — the destructure-wrapper-emission gate now
      fires whenever the LHS is heap-tracked, regardless of the
      destructure position's type, freeing the prior heap value and
      treating the non-string position as a borrow. See
      `../aether/CHANGELOG.md` § [0.149.0] (Regression B).
      `test_pyproject_content` passes on 0.161.0.
- [x] **0.146 regression: bare `_` is a single type-bound variable,
      not a per-use fresh discard.** Fixed upstream (aether `[current]`
      / post-0.162.0) — filed via `aeb-ae-help-and-toolchain-feedback.md`
      #4. `_` is no longer registered as a symbol; each occurrence is
      an independent discard and a plain `_ = <expr>` lowers to
      `(void)(<expr>)`. The `_status` workaround at
      `tests/test_cache.ae` was reverted to bare `_`.
- [ ] `module` as a variable name silently breaks codegen — should be
      a reserved word or the codegen should handle it
- [ ] Module function return type inference fails when first `return`
      is a literal `0` — infers `int` instead of `ptr`. Workaround:
      return `map_get(m, "_null_")` to force ptr type.
- [x] `MAX_MODULE_TOKENS` was 2000, needed 20000 for the build SDK.
      (Fixed: bumped to 20000 in `aether_module.h`)
- [x] Module function return types not inferred across module boundaries.
      (Fixed: `lookup_symbol` → `lookup_qualified_symbol` in `typechecker.c`,
       with void/unknown guard to avoid regressing pure-Aether return types.
       Regression test added: `tests/integration/module_return_types/`)
- [ ] `const char*` vs `void*` warnings on every `map_put`/`list_add`
      call. The codegen should emit casts for `string` → `ptr` params.
- [ ] **macOS link step fails with duplicate symbol errors.** Root
      cause: the Aether compiler emits imported module functions (e.g.
      `rust_cargo_build`, `build__mkdirs`) into every translation unit
      without a `static` qualifier. GNU ld silently dedupes them via
      the `-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition` flag currently hard-coded
      in `tools/aeb-link.ae:294`. That flag is GNU ld only — Apple's
      ld64 rejects it, and `-multiply_defined,suppress` was removed in
      Xcode 15. Consequence: a full `./aeb` multi-module run fails
      with duplicate-symbol errors on macOS.
      Two fixes, in order of preference:
      (1) **Upstream compiler fix** — `compiler/codegen/` should either
      mark imported module functions `static` so each TU gets a private
      copy, or emit each function exactly once with `extern` declarations
      in the callers. This is the root-cause fix and unblocks macOS for
      every downstream tool, not just aeb.
      (2) **Local workaround in `aeb-link.ae`** — platform-gate the
      link flag so Linux keeps `-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition` and
      macOS drops it. Useful for small builds that happen to not have
      duplicate symbols, buys time until (1) ships.
      Until this is fixed, macOS users can run the unit tests
      (`./tests/run.sh`) but `./aeb` itself cannot link full builds.
- [ ] `maven.classpath` resolution fails when a test file imports
      `java` (which imports `maven`). Reproduces on `test_javac_cmd.ae`,
      `test_junit_cmd.ae`, `test_kotlinc_cmd.ae` via `./tests/run.sh`.
      Likely a qualified-symbol resolution issue across two levels of
      module imports.
- [x] **`ae help` library hint files (`*.help.md`) were stdlib-only.**
      Fixed upstream (aether `[current]` / post-0.162.0) — filed via
      `aeb-ae-help-and-toolchain-feedback.md` #1+#2. `ae help` now
      accepts `--lib` and `find_help_md_path` probes each `--lib`
      entry's `<name>/` dir. aeb now ships hint files:
      `lib/bash/bash.help.md`, `lib/aether/aether.help.md`,
      `lib/build/build.help.md`. They ride inside the module dirs, so
      `aeb --init`'s `.aeb/lib/<name>` symlinks carry them to consumer
      repos automatically — no `shipped_modules()` change needed.
- [ ] **`ae help` still reports project-library calls as undefined.**
      Even with `--lib lib`, `ae help` on a `.build.ae` flags
      `build.start` / `bash.script` etc. as `undefined function` —
      the `*.help.md` hints fire correctly alongside, but the output
      is signal + noise. Likely the same transitive qualified-symbol
      resolution gap as the `maven.classpath` item above. Filed as a
      follow-up in `aeb-ae-help-and-toolchain-feedback.md`.

## Build environment validation

Run before any module builds. Fail fast with install hints.

```aether
build.env(b) {
    tool("javac", ">= 21")
    tool("kotlinc")
    tool("go", ">= 1.24")
    tool("rustc", ">= 1.78")
    tool("cargo")
    tool("tsc")
    tool("node")
}
```

## Per-task sandboxing (phase 2)

Wrap SDK calls in sandbox grants:

```aether
build.javac(b) {
    sandbox() {
        grant_fs_read("src/**")
        grant_fs_write("target/**")
        grant_exec("javac")
    }
}
```

## ~~`aeb --init` documentation~~ (done)

Documented in README.

## Trailing-block DSL for remaining languages

All language SDKs now use `defer` functions with trailing-block DSL:

- [x] `javac()` / `javac_test()` — release, source, target, lint, encoding, etc.
- [x] `junit()` — jvm_args, extra
- [x] `kotlinc()` / `kotlinc_test()` — jvm_target, api_version, language_version
- [x] `go_build()` / `go_test()` — build_mode, output_file, tags, ldflags, race, env_var
- [x] `cargo_build()` — lib_name, profile, features, jobs
- [x] `tsc()` — strict, ts_target, module_kind, out_dir
- [x] `mocha()` — mocha_timeout, reporter, mocha_grep

## Test coverage gaps (this session, deliberately deferred)

The round-218 backfill (`tests/test_aether_*.ae`, `tests/test_bash_*.ae`,
`tests/test_file_to_label.ae`) covered the pure string-builders for
this session's SDK additions: `aetherc_emit_lib_cmd`,
`aether_link_cmd`, `bash_xargs_cmd`, `bash_runner_body`, plus the
mtime-driven `_regen_action` and the install-layout resolvers (with
filesystem fixtures). Three behaviours are still uncovered. None
blocks any consumer; all need either a refactor or harness work that
wasn't worth doing in-session.

### `_run_regen_pass` integration

`_run_regen_pass` in `lib/aether/module.ae` orchestrates the full
.ae → _generated.c regen flow: derive paired paths, mtime-check via
`file.mtime`, resolve caps (explicit or auto-detect), invoke real
`aetherc --emit=lib` via `os.system`, append to `extra_source`,
hard-fail on aetherc error.

The pure parts are already factored out (`_paired_generated_c`,
`_regen_action`, `_detect_caps_from_content`, `aetherc_emit_lib_cmd`)
and unit-tested. The orchestration loop itself isn't testable
without either:

- Stubbing aetherc with a recording wrapper script that captures
  args. Doable; needs a small bash fixture under `tests/fixtures/`
  and a per-test PATH override.
- Or extracting a "planner" function that returns a list of
  `(ae_path, c_path, caps, action)` records without invoking
  aetherc, then testing the planner. Simpler but means the actual
  aetherc-invocation loop is still uncovered.

End-to-end smoke (`/tmp/aeb-regen-smoke`) covers the integration
today. Worth formalising into a `tests/integration/` directory if
this gap bites.

### `bash.test` parallel-mode end-to-end

`bash.test(b) { jobs(N) }` writes scratch files (item list, runner
script), invokes `xargs -P` via `os.exec`, parses stdout with
`_parse_xargs_output`. The string-builders (`bash_xargs_cmd`,
`bash_runner_body`) and the parser are unit-tested. The dispatch
loop isn't — would need a fixture tree of `test_*.sh` files plus
a way to assert the resulting parallel runtime ordering, which is
non-deterministic. End-to-end smoke (`/tmp/aeb-bash-smoke`) covers
this today.

### Three-copy `file_to_label` drift detection — RESOLVED

~~The label-derivation logic exists in three places that must stay
in sync.~~ Consolidated. The three former copies
(`tools/file-to-label.ae`, `tools/gen-orchestrator.ae`,
`tools/aeb-link.ae`) now all `import aeblabel` from the single
canonical module `tools/aeblabel/module.ae`. `tests/run.sh` builds
with `--lib lib --lib tools` (multi-entry `--lib`, aether 0.150) so
`tests/test_file_to_label.ae` imports the *same* module the build
path runs — no fourth inlined copy. Drift is now structurally
impossible: there is one implementation. Tool builds thread
`--lib tools` through the Makefile (`AEFLAGS`), `aeb-main`'s
aeb-link build, and `aeb-link`'s gen-orchestrator build.

Consolidation also closed three latent inconsistencies the copies
had drifted into: `gen-orchestrator` classified types with
`string.contains` (vs `ends_with`) and computed dirname via a
`os.exec("dirname ...")` subprocess (vs the pure `dirname_pure`);
`aeb-link` open-coded suffix slicing in `infer_type`.

## Container SDK — Proxmox support

The container module currently supports OCI images (podman/docker) and
LXC containers. Proxmox adds two more backends, both using the same
DSL-setter pattern.

### `container.pct()` — Proxmox LXC containers

Local mode (on the Proxmox host, shells out to `pct`):

```aether
import container
import container (template, hostname, memory, cores, net, storage)

container.pct(b) {
    template("local:vztmpl/ubuntu-24.04-standard_24.04-2_amd64.tar.zst")
    hostname("web-1")
    memory("2048")
    cores("2")
    net("name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,ip=dhcp")
    storage("local-lvm")
}
```

Generates: `pct create <vmid> <template> --hostname web-1 --memory 2048 --cores 2 --net0 name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,ip=dhcp --storage local-lvm`

Remote mode (over the wire via Proxmox REST API):

```aether
container.pct(b) {
    host("pve.internal:8006")
    api_token("user@pam!aeb", "token-secret")
    node("pve1")
    template("local:vztmpl/ubuntu-24.04-standard_24.04-2_amd64.tar.zst")
    hostname("web-1")
    memory("2048")
}
```

Generates: `curl -k -X POST https://pve.internal:8006/api2/json/nodes/pve1/lxc -H "Authorization: PVEAPIToken=user@pam!aeb=token-secret" -d 'ostemplate=local:vztmpl/...'`

### Local vs remote convention

The `host()` setter is the boundary. Present → remote API call via curl.
Absent → local CLI. Same DSL setters for the container config either way.
This convention extends to any future backends that have both local and
remote modes.

### Additional Proxmox setters

- `host(addr)` — Proxmox API address (e.g. `pve.internal:8006`)
- `api_token(user, secret)` — PVE API token for auth
- `node(name)` — target Proxmox node
- `hostname(name)` — container hostname
- `memory(mb)` — RAM in MB
- `cores(n)` — CPU cores
- `swap(mb)` — swap in MB
- `disk(spec)` — root disk (e.g. `local-lvm:8`)
- `net(spec)` — network interface config
- `storage(name)` — storage target
- `vmid(id)` — explicit VM ID (auto-assign if omitted)
- `unprivileged()` — create as unprivileged container
- `start_on_create()` — start immediately after creation
- `ssh_key(path)` — inject SSH public key

### `container.qm()` — Proxmox VMs (future)

Same pattern for full VMs via `qm create`. Lower priority — containers
cover most deployment use cases.

### Test approach

Same as other SDKs: test the command string builders (`pct_create_cmd`,
`pct_api_cmd`) in isolation. No Proxmox host needed for tests.

## In-process language hosting via `aeb-link`

`container.run` runs a guest language as a *separate process* (a
container). Aether's other option — `contrib.host.<lang>` (Lua,
Python, Perl, Ruby, Tcl, JS) — embeds the interpreter *in-process*:
the bridge is linked into the binary and the guest runs in its
address space. For aeb that means the guest would run inside the
orchestrator (`target/_ae_build_all`), which is the purest fit for
the one-process model. The container-vs-hosted tradeoff is written
up in `docs/guest-languages.md`.

It does **not** work from a real `.build.ae` yet. The orchestrator
linker (`tools/aeb-link`) doesn't link foreign-language bridges, so
`import contrib.host.lua` resolves but `lua.run(...)` fails to link.
The work:

- `aeb-link` detects `import contrib.host.<lang>` anywhere in the
  module closure.
- For each, it adds the bridge `.c`, `-DAETHER_HAS_<LANG>`,
  `-DAETHER_HAS_SANDBOX`, and `pkg-config` cflags/libs to the
  orchestrator's gcc invocation — exactly what
  `tests/test_host_lua.build.sh` does for the test today. That
  sidecar is the working reference; promote its logic into `aeb-link`.
- Degrade gracefully: no dev library → stub mode (the bridge's
  `#else` no-ops), so a missing `liblua` never fails the build.

Blocked-ish upstream: the installed Aether tree ships
`contrib/host/<lang>/` with `.ae`/`.h`/`README` but not
`aether_host_<lang>.c`, so the bridge source is currently only
locatable from a sibling Aether checkout. A clean fix wants Aether to
ship the bridge `.c` (or fold the stubs into `libaether`) — flagged
for the Aether side.

## ~~Build environment validation~~ (not doing)

Decided against `aeb --check`. The build already fails fast with a clear
error when a tool is missing, scoped to exactly the module that needed it.
A pre-flight check would need to stay in sync with SDK internals, and
would report missing tools you don't even need. If a specific SDK's
failure message is ever cryptic, fix that message rather than adding a
separate validation system.

## Scala

1. Assembly jar / fat jar packaging — replace `scala-cli --power package`.
   Needs a `scala.shade(b)` or reuse of `java.shade(b)` since Scala
   compiles to .class files on the JVM.

2. Scala version DSL — `scala_version("3.8.2")` setter exists but
   untested with versions other than 3.8.2. Cross-compilation
   (2.13 + 3.x) not supported.

3. sbt project migration — the current itest uses scala-cli's
   `//> using` convention. An sbt multi-module project (with
   `build.sbt`, `project/`, sub-projects) would prove aeb can replace
   sbt end-to-end. The Scala SDK already does direct `scalac` invocation
   so it's just a matter of writing `.build.ae` files for a real sbt project.

4. Compiler plugins — some Scala projects use compiler plugins
   (e.g. wartremover, better-monadic-for). Would need a
   `compiler_plugin("org.wartremover:wartremover_3:version")` setter
   that adds `-Xplugin:path.jar` to the scalac invocation.

## .NET

1. Hierarchical config via `load_config()` — a shared `.config.ae` file
   that sets default DSL values (sdk, target_framework, nullable, etc.),
   loadable at the top of each `.build.ae`. Leaf projects override
   individual setters. aeb generates the complete `.csproj` every time —
   no `Directory.Build.props` inheritance, no MSBuild walking up the
   tree. The `.build.ae` is the single source of truth.

2. Eliminate `Directory.Packages.props` — move NuGet version management
   into aeb. Either a shared `.versions.ae` file or version suffixes on
   `nuget("PackageName:1.2.3")`. Central version pinning becomes an aeb
   concern, not an MSBuild concern.

3. `dotnet publish` / deployment packaging — the current SDK has
   `build_project` and `test` but no publish/container/self-contained
   deployment support.

4. F# support — the SDK auto-detects `.fsproj` but hasn't been tested
   with F# projects. Should work since MSBuild handles F# the same way.

5. Multi-targeting (`net8.0;net10.0`) — the `target_framework()` setter
   currently takes a single TFM. Multi-targeting would need
   `<TargetFrameworks>` (plural) in the generated `.csproj`.

6. Package asset control — `PrivateAssets`/`IncludeAssets` on NuGet refs.
   Prevents analyzers/tools from flowing to downstream projects. Needs
   a richer `nuget()` setter, e.g. `nuget("EF.Tools", private: "all")`
   or a trailing block on nuget.

7. Conditional package references — some packages only apply in Release
   (e.g. `BuildBundlerMinifier`). Needs `nuget_if("Release", "Pkg")` or
   a `condition()` setter.

8. Content/resource copy rules — `CopyToOutputDirectory` for
   `appsettings.json`, Razor views, etc. Needed for `dotnet publish`
   and deployment. DSL: `copy_to_output("appsettings.json")`.

9. User secrets — `<UserSecretsId>` for ASP.NET Core dev-time secret
   management. DSL: `user_secrets("guid")`.

## Cross-cutting — inspired by Cake (C# Make)

Cake is a mature .NET build orchestrator. These are capabilities it has
that aeb doesn't yet, worth considering across all languages:

### Versioning

Cake integrates GitVersion for semantic versioning — the build script
knows its own version derived from git tags/branches, and injects it
into assembly metadata, package versions, and release notes. aeb has
no versioning story at all.

Possible aeb approach: a `version()` builder or DSL that reads git
tags/describes and exposes `${version}` in the build context. Language
SDKs use it for jar manifests, NuGet package versions, npm versions, etc.

### Test result reporting

aeb today has two layers of test reporting:

1. **Pass/fail counts in `[telemetry]`**: each test SDK calls
   `build._record_test_result(ctx, passed, failed)` and the
   summary shows `<passed>/<total> PASS|FAIL` per target.
2. **Persisted test stdout/stderr**: `target/<module>/test_output.log`
   captures the full test runner output for failure diagnosis.
   Currently wired in `java.junit5`, `java.junit`, `jest.test`,
   `python.pytest`, `dotnet.test`; other test SDKs still print
   only to terminal scrollback.

What's left:

- **Wire `test_output.log` for the rest of the test SDKs**:
  `bash.test`, `aether.program_test`, `go.go_test`, `rust.test`,
  `rust.test_workspace`, `kotlin.kotlin_test`, `clojure.test`,
  `scala.munit`, `ts.mocha`. Each is a small per-SDK change
  (replace `os.system(cmd)` with `tee`-to-target_dir).
- **Switch parsers to structured outputs**: today's pass/fail
  parsers regex over freeform stdout. Each test runner has a
  structured-output mode that's more correct:
  - junit-platform-console: `--reports-dir` writes JUnit XML
  - pytest: `--junit-xml=path` writes JUnit XML
  - jest: `--ci --json` writes structured JSON
  - dotnet test: `--logger trx` writes TRX (.NET XML format)
  - cargo test: `--message-format=json` (nightly) or `cargo2junit`
  - go test: `gotestsum` wraps `go test` with JUnit XML output
  Switching to structured ground truth removes the regex
  parsers and gives CI dashboards a consumable artifact at
  `target/<module>/test-results.xml` (or .json/.trx). Each SDK
  is a bounded migration; the cross-cutting decision is "stdlib
  XML/JSON parser, or shell out to a parser tool?"
- **Cross-build aggregation**: cumulative test-result history
  across builds (which test broke this morning vs yesterday).
  Needs persistent storage outside `target/`. Defer.

### Task lifecycle hooks (setup/teardown)

Cake has global and per-task setup/teardown. aeb has nothing — if a
test starts a server and crashes, the server leaks. A `teardown()`
block in `.tests.ae` would run regardless of test outcome.

### Conditional task execution

Cake tasks have `.WithCriteria()` — skip a task based on runtime
conditions (branch name, env var, flag). aeb currently runs everything
it finds. Useful for: skip integration tests in CI, skip signing
locally, skip publish on non-tag builds.

Possible: `skip_if(b, "CI != true")` or a `criteria()` DSL setter.

### NuGet/Maven package publishing

Cake has DotNetNuGetPush, NuGetPush for publishing packages to feeds.
The Java side has `mvn deploy`. aeb has `shade()` for fat jars but no
publish step — built artifacts stay local.

Needed for `.dist.ae`: a `publish()` builder or DSL that pushes to
NuGet feeds, Maven Central, npm registry, etc.

### Code signing

Cake integrates Azure Key Vault + SignTool for signing packages before
publish. Relevant for any project that ships binaries.

### CI system detection

Cake auto-detects 15+ CI systems (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins,
etc.) and adjusts behaviour — setting output variables, uploading
artifacts, detecting PR context. aeb is CI-agnostic (runs the same
everywhere), which is a strength, but knowing "am I in CI" and "is
this a PR" would enable conditional logic.

Possible: `build.is_ci()`, `build.branch()`, `build.is_pr()` functions
that read standard CI env vars (GITHUB_ACTIONS, CI, GITLAB_CI, etc.).

### Multi-SDK bootstrapping

Cake's build.sh/build.ps1 install specific .NET SDK versions before
building. aeb assumes tools are on PATH. A `require_tool("dotnet", "10.0")`
or similar could validate/install prerequisites.

## Cross-cutting — capabilities from CI-as-code (TeamCity, Jenkins)

TeamCity (Kotlin DSL) and Jenkins (Declarative + Scripted Groovy) are
CI-orchestration platforms; aeb is a build orchestrator. There's
real overlap, real divergence, and real questions about where the
boundary should sit.

This section catalogues every plausible capability from those
platforms, marked **SHOULD** / **MAYBE** / **SHOULDN'T** based on
whether the shape fits aeb's "the .ae file IS the graph node"
position. Most of the items here are deliberately not on the
roadmap — capturing the analysis so future sessions don't
re-derive it from scratch.

### The structural difference (read this first)

TeamCity and Jenkins both treat *the build invocation* as their
atomic unit. A Jenkins stage runs a script. A TeamCity build type
runs steps. The DAG nodes are opaque inside.

aeb treats *the source-tree target* as the atomic unit. A target
IS a `.ae` file. The DAG is **derived from the source tree** in
aeb, **declared separately from the source tree** in
TeamCity/Jenkins. That separation is where pipelines drift out
of sync with reality. aeb avoids it by construction.

So even if a capability looks transplantable, the right shape
in aeb is usually a new dot-prefixed `.ae` file type
(`.trigger.ae`, `.notify.ae`) discovered by file scan, not a
top-level DSL block in some root config. **Same convention as
`.build.ae` / `.tests.ae` / `.dist.ae`: discoverable, greppable,
lives next to the code it describes.**

### SHOULD — these compose with aeb's existing shape

#### `.trigger.ae` target type

Declares CI hooks alongside the code they trigger on. aeb doesn't
*fire* the trigger — it emits a schedule artifact a CI system
consumes. Same factoring as the `meta` SDK + `brew.formula`
exporter: source-of-truth lives in `.trigger.ae`; emitters
translate to GitHub Actions YAML, GitLab CI, TeamCity DSL, etc.

```aether
import build
import trigger
main() {
    b = build.start()
    trigger.cron(b, "0 4 * * *")            // nightly
    trigger.vcs_change(b, "main")           // on push to main
    trigger.path_filter(b, "java/**")       // only when Java changed
    trigger.dep(b, "java/components/.tests.ae")  // run this on trigger
}
```

`aeb --print-triggers --emit github-actions` walks every
`.trigger.ae` and writes `.github/workflows/aeb-triggered.yml`.
Single source of truth; CI YAML becomes a generated artifact.

**Why SHOULD**: composes with `--affected`, `--graph`,
`--print-affected`. New target type, same scan/parse pipeline.
No daemon, no server, just file emission.

#### `on_failure(b) { ... }` setter inside test/build closures

Symmetric to the existing `pre_command` / `post_command` /
`fixture_seed` lifecycle hooks. Fires the contained command when
the enclosing target fails. Useful for Slack/email notifications,
log capture, artifact preservation.

```aether
bash.test(b) {
    script("test_acl.sh")
    on_failure(b) {
        run_command("notify-slack 'tests failed in ${MOD}'")
        copy_to("/tmp/aeb-failures/${MOD}-$(date +%s).log")
    }
}
```

**Why SHOULD**: small extension to the lifecycle pattern we
already have. Doesn't grow into "notification ecosystem"
because the body is just a shell command — same escape hatch
`pre_command` uses.

#### Test-passage as a build dep

Today's `.dist.ae` runs whenever `aeb path/.dist.ae` is invoked,
regardless of whether the corresponding `.tests.ae` passed. A
`requires_passing(...)` setter would make distribution gated:

```aether
brew.formula(b) {
    aeb_target("lib/hello/.build.ae")
    requires_passing("lib/hello/.tests.ae")
}
```

aeb resolves the dep, runs the tests if not cached, refuses to
emit the formula if any failed.

**Why SHOULD**: closes a real safety gap (no-one wants a brew
formula for a binary whose tests don't pass) using existing
mechanism (graph dep + cache). One-line setter, ~30 LOC of
build-time check. The Aeocha-driven test-result marker we
already write means we have the data on disk to consult.

#### Artifact promotion / cross-target output passing (formalize)

Already partially done: `target/<module>/` is per-target,
downstream modules read `jvm_classpath_deps_including_transitive`
etc. via `build.dep`. What's missing is a *named* artifact API:

```aether
java.shade(b) {
    main_class("com.Main")
    output("app.jar")
    artifact("app-fat-jar", "app.jar")   // names the artifact
}
brew.formula(b) {
    consume_artifact("ae/app/.dist.ae", "app-fat-jar")
}
```

vs. today's "downstream reads a known-named file from
`target/<module>/`." Names give artifacts an explicit public
interface; renaming the file in the producer doesn't break
consumers.

**Why SHOULD**: makes implicit artifact contracts explicit. Aligns
with how Bazel/Buck/Pants do it. Doesn't grow aeb's surface much.

### MAYBE — interesting but the cost/value isn't obvious yet

#### Pipeline visualization beyond `--graph`

Today `aeb --graph` emits DOT/Mermaid of the static dep graph.
TeamCity/Jenkins UIs show *runtime* state: which steps ran in
this build, how long each took, where the failure was, what
artifacts were produced. We have the data (the `[telemetry]`
records, the `.aeb_test_failures` markers, per-target
`test_output.log`) — what's missing is a renderer that joins
them into a per-build view.

```bash
aeb --build-report --format html > target/_aeb/last-build.html
```

Static HTML, opens in a browser, no server. Force-directed
graph with nodes coloured by cache outcome / duration / pass-fail.

**Why MAYBE**: useful but cosmetic. The data is already in the
`[telemetry]` block; the HTML renderer is "just" a static-site
generator over the records list. Lower priority than functional
gaps. Defer until someone asks.

#### CI-system detection (`build.is_ci()`, `build.branch()`, `build.is_pr()`)

Cake auto-detects 15+ CI systems and exposes a unified API. aeb
is CI-agnostic today (runs the same everywhere), which is a
strength. Knowing "am I in CI" enables conditional logic
(skip-on-CI, skip-when-not-PR), which TeamCity/Jenkins handle
via build parameters.

**Why MAYBE**: small feature, mild value. Reading `$CI` /
`$GITHUB_ACTIONS` / `$JENKINS_HOME` is six lines. The
question is whether to expose it as a builder primitive or
let users read env vars in their `.ae` files. Lean: expose
sparingly when a real need surfaces.

#### Conditional task execution (Cake's `.WithCriteria()`)

Already in the Cake section above. Worth re-flagging here
because TeamCity/Jenkins both have it:

```aether
java.junit5(b) {
    criteria(b, "${BRANCH} == 'main'")
}
```

**Why MAYBE**: the implementation is environment-variable
substitution + a string equality / glob check. Cheap. The risk
is "runtime conditional execution" growing into a mini scripting
language inside `.ae` files. If we add it, keep the predicate
language *minimal* — env-var equality, env-var presence/absence,
nothing else. Don't accidentally reinvent Bash inside Aether.

#### Multi-platform / hermetic toolchain (TeamCity agent requirements)

TeamCity has `agentRequirement("teamcity.agent.jvm.os.name=Linux")`
to route a build to a matching agent. Jenkins has `agent { label
'linux' }`. aeb has nothing — it runs on the host you invoke it
on.

The aeb-shaped version is **NOT** "agent routing" — that's CI's
job. The aeb-shaped version is "validate the host has the right
toolchain version, fail fast otherwise." Exactly the
`build.env(b)` block already in the TODO. Same idea.

**Why MAYBE**: already on the roadmap as `build.env`.
Cross-listed here for the connection.

### SHOULDN'T — these break aeb's structural position

#### Agent pool / fleet management

TeamCity manages a fleet of build agents, distributes builds
across them, drains agents for maintenance, prioritises
pipelines. Jenkins has labels + nodes. aeb is a single-machine
CLI by design.

**Why SHOULDN'T**: building a fleet manager is a different
product. The right factoring is what the article on bash-vs-CI
argues: build tool decides what to do (aeb), CI orchestrator
decides where each shard runs (Buildkite/GitHub Actions/etc).
If a user wants 4-way sharding, they run `aeb --since main
--shard 1/4` four times across four runners. aeb provides the
sharding semantics; the CI provides the distribution.

#### Build history / cross-build dashboards

TeamCity/Jenkins maintain a database of every build that ever
ran. UIs show "this pipeline used to take 8 minutes, now it
takes 22, here's the commit." aeb's `[telemetry]` is per-run,
ephemeral.

**Why SHOULDN'T**: that's a server. aeb is a CLI. Building a
server is a different product (and there are several already —
BuildBuddy, EngFlow, Honeycomb-for-builds). If aeb writes
structured telemetry to a file (Tier 2 vision in the telemetry
section above), those servers can consume it. **Emit, don't
ingest.**

#### Triggers as runtime behaviour

aeb shouldn't become a daemon waiting for VCS pushes or cron
firings. The `.trigger.ae` form above is fine — emit a
schedule artifact for *another* system to consume. Becoming the
scheduler is the wrong direction.

**Why SHOULDN'T**: scope explosion. As soon as aeb fires
triggers itself, it needs durable queue management,
backpressure, retry semantics, distributed locks (multiple aeb
instances contending for a cron tick), monitoring of its own
triggers. That's a separate product called "a job scheduler"
and it's solved.

#### Notifier ecosystem (Slack / Teams / email / PagerDuty plugins)

TeamCity has built-in notifiers and a plugin system. Jenkins has
a vast plugin marketplace including 50+ notification plugins.

**Why SHOULDN'T**: ecosystem trap. Better to expose hook points
(`on_failure`) and let users shell out (`run_command("curl
$SLACK_WEBHOOK ...")`). Same factoring as how `bash.test`
exposes `pre_command` / `post_command` rather than a typed
fixture API: keep the SDK surface small, let the escape hatch
be a shell command. If the escape hatch isn't enough, the user
can write a small `.ae` SDK in `.aeb/lib/notify/module.ae` —
that's exactly the consumer-local SDK pattern documented in
LLM.md.

#### Build queue management / priority lanes

TeamCity/Jenkins let you tag builds as high/medium/low priority
and the scheduler picks accordingly. aeb runs serially in one
process; the only "queue" is the topological order.

**Why SHOULDN'T**: orthogonal to aeb's job. If you have multiple
aeb invocations contending for a CI worker pool, the CI system's
queue is what should arbitrate. aeb running on one machine is
already done in topo order.

#### Approval gates ("manual approval before deploy")

Common in CI/CD pipelines. The build pauses, a human clicks
approve, the build resumes. TeamCity calls these "manual
trigger" build types; Jenkins has `input` steps.

**Why SHOULDN'T**: aeb is a build tool, not a deployment
orchestrator. Approval gates are a deployment-pipeline concern
that lives on the CI side. The aeb-shaped equivalent is "split
your pipeline into pre-approval and post-approval stages, each
calling `aeb` for the relevant target set"; the CI handles the
human-in-the-loop.

TODO: add integration tests for every approval provider path:
`approval.jira`, `approval.servicenow`, `approval.github`,
`approval.gitlab`, `approval.azure_devops`, `approval.http`,
`approval.command`, and `approval.attestation`.

#### Generic pipeline-as-code language

The temptation: "let users write arbitrary Aether-DSL pipelines
that aeb interprets." A `pipeline { stage(...) parallel(...)
when(...) }` block.

**Why SHOULDN'T**: this *is* TeamCity/Jenkins. The whole point
of aeb's structural position is that the pipeline IS the source
tree, derived not declared. Inviting users to write arbitrary
pipelines reintroduces the source-tree-vs-pipeline drift problem
that aeb's design exists to solve.

If a user genuinely needs imperative pipeline orchestration on
top of aeb, the answer is a thin shell or Make wrapper that
calls `aeb <target>` multiple times — same factoring the bash
article we discussed argues for at the CI level.

### Summary table

| Capability | Verdict | aeb shape if SHOULD |
|---|---|---|
| Triggers (cron, VCS, path filter) | SHOULD | `.trigger.ae` + `--print-triggers` exporter |
| `on_failure(b)` lifecycle hook | SHOULD | Setter inside test/build closures |
| `requires_passing(...)` dep | SHOULD | Setter; resolver-time gate |
| Named artifacts | SHOULD | `artifact()` + `consume_artifact()` setters |
| Pipeline visualization (runtime view) | MAYBE | Static HTML from `[telemetry]` records |
| CI-system detection | MAYBE | Sparingly; expose env-var reads as primitives |
| Conditional execution | MAYBE | `criteria()` setter; minimal predicate language |
| Hermetic toolchain check | MAYBE | Already roadmap as `build.env()` |
| Agent pool / fleet routing | SHOULDN'T | CI orchestrator's job |
| Build history / dashboards | SHOULDN'T | Different product (BuildBuddy, etc.) |
| Triggers as runtime daemon | SHOULDN'T | Scope explosion; emit, don't run |
| Notifier ecosystem | SHOULDN'T | Hook + shell escape; users write own SDKs |
| Build queue / priority | SHOULDN'T | CI's queue arbitrates |
| Approval gates | SHOULDN'T | Deployment-pipeline concern, not build |
| Generic pipeline-as-code | SHOULDN'T | Reintroduces source-vs-pipeline drift |

### A note on Jenkins's `parallel { }`

Jenkins's most useful primitive is the `parallel` block — run
N stages concurrently, fail fast or wait-all. aeb already has
the equivalent at the test level (`bash.test(b) { jobs(N) }`,
`junit5` parallelism via `forkCount`) and is on track for
target-level parallelism (the "Parallel execution" item under
Runner improvements above). When that lands, "two independent
tests run concurrently" works without a `parallel { }` block —
the DAG already knows they're independent. **The DAG IS the
parallelism specification**, same way the DAG IS the
dependency specification.

This is the strongest concrete demonstration of why the
TeamCity/Jenkins shape isn't the right import path: their
`parallel` blocks exist to declare what aeb derives.

## Java/Maven

What we have today: `java.javac()` covers the maven-compiler-plugin
surface (release / source / target / lint / encoding / parameters /
debug / `--enable-preview` / `--module-path` / annotation processors /
generated sources). `java.junit()` and `java.junit5()` cover the
surefire core case. `java.shade()` builds classic fat JARs.
`maven.resolve()` + `maven.classpath()` + `load_bom_file()` handle
dependency resolution including BOM-managed versions.

Below is what's still missing measured against mainstream Maven
plugin grammars — grouped by how often a typical Java shop actually
needs each.

1. tools/aeb-resolve.jar - maybe not check that it. Maybe  have is slimmer and source transitive deps from ~/.m2/repository using the manifest. If those transitive 
deps are missing go get them and place them in there

2. ~~maven should have its own aeb module~~ (done — `lib/maven/module.ae`)

3. Surefire equivalent in aeb grammar — `build.junit(b)` already handles
   the core case (find test classes, fork JVM, run with JUnit). Missing
   pieces vs Surefire: test filtering/includes/excludes, parallel forks
   (`forkCount` / `reuseForks` / `argLine`), `parallel=classes` worker
   pool, XML report output (`target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml`).
   Single-JVM `junit5_cmd` won't scale on a real test suite. Add
   incrementally.

### Tier 1 — every serious Java project needs these

4. **Resources + resource filtering** (maven-resources-plugin). Copy
   `src/main/resources` into the classpath, optionally substituting
   `${project.version}` etc. Today `java.javac()` only sees `*.java`,
   so properties / YAML / XML / SQL resources have no path onto the
   classpath. DSL sketch:

   ```aether
   java.javac(b) {
       resources("src/main/resources")
       filter("application.yml")            // do placeholder sub
       property("project.version", "1.2.3")
   }
   ```

5. **Manifest / Main-Class** (maven-jar-plugin). Today plain `jar`
   output has no manifest control. Needed for runnable JARs and
   `-Multi-Release` headers. DSL sketch:

   ```aether
   java.jar(b) {
       main_class("com.example.Main")
       manifest_attribute("Implementation-Version", "1.2.3")
       multi_release(true)
   }
   ```

6. **Sources JAR + Javadoc JAR** (maven-source-plugin,
   maven-javadoc-plugin). `*-sources.jar` and `*-javadoc.jar` next to
   the main artifact — required by Maven Central, used by every IDE.
   Builders: `java.sources_jar(b)`, `java.javadoc(b) { link(...); doctitle(...) }`.

7. **Spring Boot fat-JAR layout** (`spring-boot-maven-plugin
   repackage`). Different from `shade()` — uses `BOOT-INF/`,
   `PropertiesLauncher`, layered jars. High leverage given the
   `itests/spring-data-examples` scale. DSL: `java.spring_boot_repackage(b)`.

8. **Integration test phase** (maven-failsafe-plugin). `*IT.java`
   pattern, separate from unit tests, post-suite verify that fails
   the build only after teardown runs. Today `junit5()` runs
   everything in one phase. Add `java.junit5_it(b)` with an `*IT`
   default include pattern and post-test cleanup hook.

9. **Code coverage** (jacoco-maven-plugin). Inject
   `-javaagent:jacocoagent.jar=destfile=...` into junit invocations
   and emit exec/HTML/XML reports. One agent flag in `junit5_cmd` +
   a small report builder. DSL:

   ```aether
   java.junit5(b) {
       coverage("jacoco")               // or coverage_off()
   }
   java.coverage_report(b) { format("xml", "html") }
   ```

### Tier 2 — needed to publish or distribute artifacts

10. **POM emission**. Maven Central (and most artifact stores) need
    a `pom.xml` next to the jar. Even Gradle has to emit one. Cheap
    to implement — a `pom_xml_content(opts, deps)` content builder in
    the same shape as the new `dotnet.csproj_content()`. Without this
    nothing aeb produces is publishable.

11. **mvn install / deploy** (maven-install-plugin,
    maven-deploy-plugin). `mvn install` populates `~/.m2` for
    cross-project local consumption; `mvn deploy` pushes to
    Nexus/Artifactory/Central. aeb's vendored/registry pattern
    doesn't write to `~/.m2`, and there's no push step at all.
    Builders: `java.install(b)`, `java.deploy(b) { repo(...);
    credentials(...) }`.

12. **GPG signing** (maven-gpg-plugin) + checksums. Central requires
    `.asc` signatures and `.md5` / `.sha1` / `.sha256` / `.sha512`
    siblings on every artifact. DSL: `java.sign(b) { key_id(...) }`,
    `java.checksums(b) { algorithms("sha256", "sha512") }`.

### Tier 3 — quality / static analysis

13. **Checkstyle / PMD / SpotBugs / Spotless**. Run as part of build,
    fail on violations. Each is a small `.cmd_string` builder
    invoking the respective standalone runner. Group under
    `java.lint(b) { checkstyle(...); spotbugs(...); spotless_check() }`
    or one builder per tool.

14. **errorprone / NullAway** (javac `-Xplugin:` style). Distinct
    from annotation processors — these ride `javac` itself. Add an
    `xplugin()` setter to `java.javac()` that emits `-Xplugin:` flags.
    Existing `processor()` covers AP path; this is the missing
    sibling.

15. **maven-enforcer-plugin** equivalents. Banned-deps,
    dep-convergence, no-snapshot-deps, required Java version. DSL:

    ```aether
    java.enforce(b) {
        require_java(">= 21")
        ban_dep("commons-logging:commons-logging")
        require_convergence()
        no_snapshots()
    }
    ```

### Tier 4 — build-system meta

16. **maven-toolchains-plugin** equivalent. Pick one of several
    installed JDKs by vendor/version per module — multi-JDK builds
    in a monorepo. Today aeb uses whatever `javac` is on PATH. This
    is the same gap as the hermetic-toolchain item in
    `bazel-gaps.md`; if that gets resolved at the runner level
    (hermetic-LLVM-style fetch + pin), this falls out.

17. **Profiles** (`<profile id="ci">`). Maven's environment-specific
    config switches. aeb has no profile concept. Could ride
    `criteria()` (cross-cutting Cake item above) plus a profile
    selector flag — same DAG, same SDK calls, just different setter
    values per profile.

18. **Properties / interpolation**. `${project.version}` and
    friends used by resources, manifest, POM, jib. Tied to the
    versioning story in the Cake section above and to (4) and (10)
    here. One `properties` map on the build context, expanded by
    each builder that reads strings.

19. **versions-maven-plugin**. `display-dependency-updates`,
    `use-latest-versions`. Mostly tooling, not build. Could be a
    standalone `aeb deps update` subcommand rather than a builder.

20. **flatten-maven-plugin**. Resolves parent/property references
    in the published POM. Only matters once (10) lands.

### Tier 5 — domain-specific

21. **protobuf-maven-plugin + os-maven-plugin**. `protoc` codegen
    with platform-specific compiler binary selection. Big for
    gRPC/Spring-gRPC shops. DSL: `proto.compile(b) { ... }` —
    probably its own SDK module rather than crammed into Java.

22. **jib-maven-plugin**. Daemonless layered OCI images. We have
    `lib/container/` via podman/docker; the Jib approach (no daemon,
    layered jars) is materially different and worth a separate
    builder.

23. **graalvm native-maven-plugin**. AOT `native-image`. DSL:
    `java.native_image(b) { no_fallback(); reflect_config(...) }`.

24. **Liquibase / Flyway**. DB migration tasks. Probably its own
    `db.migrate(b) { ... }` SDK rather than under Java.

### Suggested order if attacking this

POM emission (10) → Resources (4) → Manifest (5) → Sources/Javadoc
(6) → Spring Boot repackage (7) → Surefire forking + XML reports (3)
→ Jacoco (9). That sequence unblocks "publishable library" and
"runnable Spring Boot app" — the two shapes most Java itests in this
repo actually exercise.
