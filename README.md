# aeb

> Your build is a graph whether you acknowledge it or not.

A build system for polyglot monorepos. Small declarative files replace
Makefiles, `pom.xml`, `package.json` scripts, `deps.edn`, `Cargo.toml`,
`.csproj`, and `pyproject.toml` — and replace them consistently across
languages. Convention does the work; you declare the intent.

(`aeb` was originally short for "Aether Build" — the runner is written
in Aether and was the project's first non-trivial Aether application.)

## What it looks like

A Java component with one dependency:

```aether
import build
import java

main() {
    b = build.start()
    build.dep(b, "java/components/vowelbase/.build.ae")
    java.javac(b)
}
```

A Rust shared library that depends on a vendored `jni` crate:

```aether
import build
import rust
import rust (crate_name, edition, crate_type, lib_path, lib_name)

main() {
    b = build.start()
    build.dep(b, "libs/rust/registry/vendor/jni/.jni.crate.ae")
    rust.cargo_project(b) {
        crate_name("vowelbase")
        edition("2021")
        crate_type("cdylib")
        lib_path("lib.rs")
        lib_name("libvowelbase.so")
    }
}
```

A JUnit test module with vendored `junit.jar`:

```aether
import build
import java

main() {
    b = build.start()
    build.dep(b, "java/components/vowelbase/.build.ae")
    build.dep(b, "libs/java/junit/.junit.jar.ae")
    build.dep(b, "libs/java/hamcrest/.hamcrest.jar.ae")
    java.javac_test(b)
    java.junit(b)
}
```

A Spring Boot test module with Maven dependencies via a BOM:

```aether
import build
import java
import maven (load_bom_file)
import java (release, source_layout, enable_preview, parameters)

main() {
    b = build.start()
    build.dep(b, "jpa/example/.build.ae")
    load_bom_file(b, "../../spring-boot.bom.ae")
    build.dep(b, "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test")
    build.dep(b, "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-data-jpa-test")
    java.javac_test(b) {
        release("25")
        source_layout("maven idiomatic")
        enable_preview()
        parameters()
    }
    java.junit5(b) {
        enable_preview()
    }
}
```

## How it works

A module's build intent lives in one or more dot-prefixed `.ae` files:

| File                       | Role                                      |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `.build.ae`                | compile the module                        |
| `.build-<tag>.ae`          | additional binary in the same module dir  |
| `.tests.ae`                | compile + run tests                       |
| `.tests-<tag>.ae`          | additional test binary in the same dir    |
| `.dist.ae`                 | package (fat jar, Docker image, wheel…)   |
| `.dist-<tag>.ae`           | additional packaging variant              |
| `.{name}.jar.ae`           | vendored JVM jar                          |
| `.{name}.crate.ae`    | vendored / registry Rust crate            |
| `.{name}.npm.ae`      | vendored / registry npm package           |
| `.{name}.nupkg.ae`    | vendored / registry NuGet package         |
| `.{name}.whl.ae`      | vendored / registry Python wheel          |

#### Multiple build files per directory

A module dir can hold more than one of each role using a `<tag>`
suffix. Useful when the same source tree produces multiple binaries
(e.g. a server and a paired seeder), or runs multiple test phases
against shared sources:

```
ae/myserver/
├── .build.ae           # → label "ae/myserver"
├── .build-seed.ae      # → label "ae/myserver:seed"
├── .tests.ae           # → label "test:ae/myserver"
└── .tests-it.ae        # → label "test:ae/myserver:it"
```

Each tagged file is its own graph node — `aeb --graph` shows them
separately, `aeb --since` walks them independently, and a downstream
`build.dep("ae/myserver/.build-seed.ae")` references just the seed
target. The labels appear in `[telemetry]` so you can see per-target
timing for each binary.

The runner (`aeb`) does four things:

1. **Scan** — walk the tree and collect every `.*.ae` file
2. **Graph** — grep each `dep(b, "…")` line to derive a file-based DAG
3. **Sort** — topologically order the files
4. **Generate + link** — produce a single orchestrator `.ae` file with one
   function per module, compile them all to C, link into a single native
   binary, run it

The generated binary is one process with one in-memory visited-module map.
Each module function calls its deps directly — no subprocesses, no
file-based coordination. Per-module artifacts (classpaths, library paths,
crate paths, NuGet refs, source paths) are written to `target/<module>/`
so downstream modules can read and compose them transitively.

File paths encode to C-safe function names:

```
java/components/vowelbase/.build.ae
→ java_components_vowelbase__D_build_D_ae
```

(`/` → `_`, `.` → `_D_`, `-` → `_H_`, `_` → `__`.)

## Setup

Initialize a repo to use aeb:

```bash
/path/to/aeb/aeb --init
```

This creates symlinks in `.aeb/lib/` for every shipped SDK module and
adds `.aeb/` to `.gitignore`. Safe to re-run.

## Running

```bash
# Build and test everything under the current directory:
aeb

# Run one target (file-based):
aeb jpa/example/.build.ae
aeb jpa/example/.tests.ae

# Or from inside the module directory:
cd jpa/example && aeb .tests.ae
```

aeb auto-detects Podman's socket and sets `DOCKER_HOST` so TestContainers
works without a daemon.

### Sparse checkout (`aeb gcheckout`)

`aeb gcheckout` walks the `.ae`-file dependency DAG starting from a target
and adds each visited module's directory to the VCS sparse-checkout, so a
monorepo consumer can fetch only the modules they actually need.

```bash
aeb gcheckout --init                      # enable sparse-checkout, add scaffolding
aeb gcheckout add jpa/example/.tests.ae   # walk DAG from target, sparse-add each dir
aeb gcheckout add java/components/vowels  # directory form (resolves to .build.ae etc.)
aeb gcheckout --reset                     # disable sparse-checkout
```

The walk goes through the same `extract-deps` tool the rest of `aeb` uses,
so any `.jar.ae` / `.crate.ae` / `.npm.ae` / `.nupkg.ae` / `.whl.ae`
third-party dep file is followed automatically.

> **Note** — the implementation currently shells out to `git
> sparse-checkout` and is therefore Git-only. Mercurial support would need
> a small VCS abstraction layer (`narrowhg` extension on the hg side, or
> a different command per VCS). The dep-walking logic itself is
> VCS-agnostic and would be reused unchanged.

### Typical output

```
aeb: 18 compile + 2 dist + 17 test
  compile: rust/components/vowelbase
  compile: java/components/vowelbase
  ...
  dist:    java/applications/monorepos_rule
  test:    javatests/components/vowelbase
  ...
javatests/components/vowelbase: tests PASSED
```

### Test output is preserved

Each test SDK that participates writes its full stdout+stderr to
`target/<module>/test_output.log` for failure diagnosis after the
build. Terminal scrollback isn't reliable (especially in CI), so
the persisted file is the authoritative record. Currently wired
in `java.junit5`, `java.junit`, `jest.test`, `python.pytest`, and
`dotnet.test`; other SDKs are tracked for follow-up.

### Build graph visualisation (`aeb --graph`)

`aeb --graph` emits the build-file DAG as a graphviz DOT description
on stdout. `aeb --graph mermaid` emits a Mermaid flowchart suitable
for Markdown.

```bash
# Render to SVG via graphviz
aeb --graph | dot -Tsvg > deps.svg

# Render to PNG
aeb --graph | dot -Tpng > deps.png

# Embed in Markdown via Mermaid (renders inline on GitHub)
aeb --graph mermaid > deps.md
```

The graph reflects exactly what the build pipeline sees: every
dot-prefixed `.ae` target under cwd, with edges drawn from each
`build.dep("path/.foo.ae")` line. No render-only data; this is the
authoritative DAG. Useful for debugging "why isn't X depending on
Y", reviewing dep changes in a PR, or onboarding someone to a
monorepo's structure.

### Build graph queries

`aeb query`, `aeb owners`, `aeb path`, and `aeb why` answer read-only
questions against the same build-file DAG that `aeb --graph` renders.
They scan the tree, write `target/_aeb/_edges.txt`, print the answer,
and exit before compiling or running any target.

```bash
# Transitive dependencies of a target
aeb query 'deps(apps/api/.build.ae)'

# Transitive reverse dependencies of a target
aeb query 'rdeps(libs/core/.build.ae)'

# Owning .ae target(s) for a source path, using the same nearest
# enclosing-build-file rule as --since / --print-affected.
aeb owners apps/api/src/main/java/com/acme/Api.java

# One dependency path from a target to another target
aeb path apps/api/.dist.ae libs/core/.build.ae

# Alias for path, intended for "why does this depend on that?"
aeb why apps/api/.dist.ae libs/core/.build.ae
```

The query expression should be quoted in a shell because unquoted
parentheses are shell syntax. `deps(...)` walks dependency edges
outward; `rdeps(...)` walks reverse edges to consumers.

### Affected-target detection (`aeb --since`, `aeb --print-affected`)

`aeb --since <git-ref>` builds only the targets transitively
impacted by changes since `<git-ref>`. `aeb --print-affected <ref>`
lists them without building.

```bash
# CI shape: in a PR, build/test only what the PR touched.
aeb --since main
aeb --since origin/main          # vs the merge base
aeb --since HEAD~10              # vs 10 commits back

# Inspect the impact set without building (one path per line).
aeb --print-affected main
```

The walk: `git diff --name-only <ref>` → list of changed paths →
each path's owning target (nearest enclosing dir with a build
file) → reverse-dep BFS → affected target set. Targets outside
the impact set don't run.

Source-to-target ownership uses **nearest enclosing dir with a
build file**. A change to `lib/foo/src/main.c` is owned by the
nearest `.build*.ae` walking up: `lib/foo/.build.ae` if present,
else `lib/.build.ae`, else nothing. Multiple build files in one
dir (the `.build-<tag>.ae` case) all share ownership of files in
that dir.

Combines well with cache integration: targets that are affected
but cache-hit on their inputs still skip work. Telemetry shows
what built and what hit the cache.

#### Filter by target type (`aeb --pattern`)

`--pattern <glob>` intersects the build set with paths whose
basename matches a POSIX fnmatch pattern. Designed for CI
shapes where you want only one *type* of impacted target —
typically tests on a PR check, distributions on a release tag:

```bash
# PR check: run only tests impacted by the PR. Skip .build.ae,
# .dist.ae rebuild rows.
aeb --since main --pattern '.tests.ae'

# Cover convention variations (.tests.ae, .tests-it.ae, etc.)
aeb --since main --pattern '.tests*.ae'

# Release pipeline: build only impacted .dist.ae packagers.
aeb --since main --pattern '.dist.ae'

# All matching targets in the tree (no diff filter).
aeb --pattern '.tests.ae'

# Inspect the filtered set without running it.
aeb --print-affected main --pattern '.tests.ae'
```

The match is against the file's basename, so `.tests.ae`
matches both `lib/foo/.tests.ae` and `apps/bar/.tests.ae`.
Empty intersection (pattern matched nothing in the affected
set) exits 0 with a clear note — distinct from "nothing was
affected at all," which is also exit 0 but a different message.

`--pattern` composes with `--since`, `--coverage`, position-
agnostic. Build telemetry rolls up across the filtered set in
one `[telemetry]` block (vs. piping `--print-affected` through
`xargs aeb`, which would produce N separate blocks and re-scan
the tree N times).

#### Shard target sets for CI (`aeb --shard`)

`--shard N/M` deterministically partitions the current build set after
`--since` and `--pattern` filtering. This lets CI fan out the same aeb
selection across multiple runners while keeping aeb responsible for
stable target assignment.

```bash
# Runner 2 of 8: impacted test targets only
aeb --since main --pattern '.tests*.ae' --shard 2/8

# Four-way split of all test targets under cwd
aeb --pattern '.tests*.ae' --shard 1/4
aeb --pattern '.tests*.ae' --shard 2/4
aeb --pattern '.tests*.ae' --shard 3/4
aeb --pattern '.tests*.ae' --shard 4/4
```

The shard key is the sorted target path list. Shard `1/M` receives
positions `0, M, 2M...`; shard `2/M` receives `1, M+1...`, and so on.
Empty shards exit 0 with a clear note. CI owns runner allocation and
parallel job scheduling; aeb owns the deterministic partitioning.

#### Composite targets via `build.scan()`

Where `--pattern` is the imperative one-shot ("filter to .tests.ae
right now"), `build.scan()` is the declarative recurring form:
commit a composite `.ae` file once, point CI at it forever.

```aether
// .all-tests.ae at the repo root
import build
main() {
    b = build.start()
    build.scan(b, "**/.tests.ae")
}
```

```bash
aeb .all-tests.ae --since main          # recurring CI shape
aeb .all-tests.ae --since main --coverage
```

`build.scan(b, "<glob>")` expands to every matching `.ae` file at
build-graph extraction time (the same grep pass that picks up
`build.dep` lines), so the DAG is still grep-extractable from the
source tree — `aeb --graph`, `aeb --since`, `aeb --print-affected`
all see the expanded set.

Composes naturally with manual deps and other scans:

```aether
// .smoke-tests.ae — narrower aggregator
main() {
    b = build.start()
    build.scan(b, "javatests/components/**/.tests.ae")
    build.scan(b, "csharptests/components/**/.tests.ae")
}

// .integration.ae — compose scans with explicit deps
main() {
    b = build.start()
    build.dep(b, ".smoke-tests.ae")
    build.dep(b, ".release-builds.ae")
    build.dep(b, "end-to-end/.tests.ae")
}
```

Implementation notes:

- Patterns are POSIX globs with `**` recursive marker (auto-prepended
  with `./` so the marker fires from depth 0). `*` is single-level.
- A `scan()` call's pattern matching its own file is silently
  excluded — self-loop avoidance.
- Zero matches is a hard error at runtime (typo protection — better
  to fail loudly than silently produce a green build that ran nothing).
- `build.dep` and `build.scan` interleave freely: dedup is automatic.

### Watch mode (`aeb --watch`)

`aeb --watch [target]` does an initial build, then watches every
source directory and re-runs aeb (against the affected-target
set) on every change. Save a file, the right things rebuild —
most cache-hit, telemetry shows what actually ran.

```bash
# Watch everything visible from cwd
aeb --watch

# Watch with an initial-build target
aeb --watch ae/myserver
```

Platform support:
- **Linux**: requires `inotifywait` from `inotify-tools` (apt:
  `inotify-tools`, dnf: `inotify-tools`).
- **macOS**: requires `fswatch` (`brew install fswatch`).

`target/`, `.aeb/`, and `.git/` are excluded from the watch (the
build itself writes there; including them would feedback-loop).
Per-target test output (`test_output.log`), cache markers
(`.aeb_cache`), and timestamps are also excluded.

The watch list is computed from the edges file at start; only
directories that *exist on disk* are watched, so it composes
cleanly with `aeb gcheckout`'s sparse-checkout (dirs that
sparse-checkout has hidden don't error). Re-running aeb-watch
after `aeb gcheckout add ...` picks up the newly materialised
dirs.

### Build telemetry (`[telemetry]` block)

Every `aeb` run prints a per-target summary at the end. No
configuration; no opt-in flag.

```
[telemetry]
  compile: java/components/vowelbase     1.21s [miss]
  compile: rust/components/vowelbase     0.01s [hit]
  test:    javatests/components/vowelbase 3.03s [n/a] 17/17 PASS
  test:    apptests/integration          5.40s [n/a] 28/30 FAIL
            - blame against demo	expected 'alice' got 'bob'
            - log shows three commits	exit 1
total: 9.65s wall
aeb: 2 compile + 0 dist + 2 test
```

Per-target row format: `<type>: <label> <wall>s [<cache>] <P>/<T> PASS|FAIL`

- **`<type>`** — `compile` / `test` / `dist`. Derived from the file
  type (`.build.ae` → compile, `.tests.ae` → test, `.dist.ae` → dist).
- **`<label>`** — module path, with `:tag` suffix for tagged build
  files (see "Multiple build files per directory" above).
- **`<wall>s`** — wall time in seconds, two decimals.
- **`[<cache>]`** — content-addressed cache outcome:
  `hit` (used cached output, skipped work) /
  `miss` (cache key didn't match, ran the build) /
  `unavailable` (cache disabled or errored) /
  `n/a` (this SDK doesn't participate in caching yet).
- **`<P>/<T> PASS|FAIL`** — only on test rows. P passed of T total.
  Verdict is `FAIL` if any failed.

When a test target fails AND the SDK provides per-test detail
(currently `aether.driver_test` driven by `contrib.aeocha`),
failed test names are indented under the FAIL line with their
failure messages. Other test SDKs (jest, junit5, bash.test, etc.)
report counts only — adding per-test-name detail is per-SDK
follow-up.

The bottom-line summary (`total: 9.65s wall`) is wall-clock for
the whole build session. `aeb: 2 compile + 0 dist + 2 test` is
the count of targets that ran (independent of cache outcome).

#### Machine-readable build outputs

CI systems can request JSON sidecar files without changing what aeb
prints to stdout:

```bash
aeb \
  --telemetry-json target/_aeb/telemetry.json \
  --artifacts-json target/_aeb/artifacts.json \
  --tests-json target/_aeb/tests.json
```

- **Telemetry JSON** contains the same per-target records that feed the
  `[telemetry]` block: label, type, wall time, cache outcome, and test
  counts when present.
- **Tests JSON** contains only test rows, with pass/fail counts,
  verdict, cache outcome, and failed-test detail when an SDK provides it.
- **Artifacts JSON** lists non-internal files found under each target's
  `target/<module>/` directory after the run, with target label, type,
  name, path, and target directory.

These files are intended for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Buildkite,
TeamCity, Jenkins, and other consumers that need structured data while
keeping aeb itself CI-agnostic.

### Content-addressed cache

aeb caches per-target build artifacts by hash of the inputs. Same
shape as Bazel's local cache or sccache. When inputs (sources +
flags + classpath + toolchain version) hash to a key already in
the cache, the cached artifact is restored and the build step is
skipped — `[hit]` in `[telemetry]`.

Storage:

- Default location: `~/.aeb/cache/` (override with `$AEB_CACHE_DIR`).
- Content-addressed via sha256; entries are zlib-compressed.
- No size cap or eviction yet; users prune manually if needed.

Currently wired (other SDKs report `[n/a]` and skip the cache):

- **`lib/aether`** — manual-path link binary
- **`lib/java`** — `javac` and `javac_test` classes trees (tar+zlib)
- **`lib/maven`** — resolved classpath (separate cache from per-target)

When you run `aeb` twice in a row with no source changes, the
second run is mostly `[hit]` lines. When you change a single
source file, only its target and its direct downstream rebuild;
everything else stays cached. The `--coverage` flag is part of
the cache key, so coverage and non-coverage builds segregate
cleanly (you don't get a stale instrumented binary when you
asked for a clean build, or vice versa).

The cache works orthogonally to incremental-build mtimes (which
SDKs check independently). Incremental skips work that's
clearly redundant on this machine; the cache shares work across
machines (when remote storage backends ship — see TODO.md).

### Coverage (`aeb --coverage`)

Cross-cutting build flag — every SDK that knows what coverage
means for its language honors it; SDKs that don't (e.g. `bash.test`)
ignore it.

```bash
aeb --coverage                        # build everything with coverage
aeb --coverage <target>               # one target, with coverage
aeb --coverage --since main           # affected-targets, with coverage
```

Currently wired in `lib/aether/`:

- `aether.program`/`aether.program_test` shell-out path: appends
  `--coverage` to `ae build` (the Aether 0.115 feature). The
  driver injects `gcc --coverage` and forces `-O0 -g` for
  accurate `.ae.gcov` line attribution.
- `aether.program`/`aether.program_test` manual path (when
  `extra_source`/`link_flag`/`regen` is declared): swaps gcc's
  `-O2` for `-O0 -g --coverage`.

After running an instrumented binary, `.gcda` files appear next
to the binary. aeb does not render reports — delegate to your
preferred tool:

```bash
# graphviz / per-file gcov reports
gcov -p -b -c target/<module>/bin/<binary>-*.gcda

# HTML report via gcovr
gcovr -r . --html --html-details -o coverage.html
```

The cache key includes the coverage flag, so `aeb` and `aeb --coverage`
back-to-back both run real builds (no stale instrumented hit when
you wanted a clean build, or vice versa).

Other SDKs (java, jest, pytest, dotnet, go, rust, etc.) have
their own native coverage flows (jacoco, jest --coverage,
coverage.py, dotnet test --collect, `-cover`, llvm-cov, etc.) —
not yet wired through `aeb --coverage`. Tracked in TODO.md as
follow-up.

### Distribution metadata (`meta` SDK) and exporters (`brew`, …)

Distribution is just another target type. Declare metadata via
the `meta` SDK and an exporter closure (e.g. `brew.formula(b)`)
inside a `.dist.ae` file; `aeb` walks it like any other target,
running the exporter to emit the formula.

```aether
// lib/hello/.dist.ae
import build
import meta
import brew
import brew (aeb_target, binary)

main() {
    b = build.start()
    meta.desc(b, "Tiny hello-world greeter")
    meta.homepage(b, "https://example.com/hello")
    meta.license(b, "MIT")
    meta.version(b, "0.1.0")
    meta.url(b, "https://example.com/dl/hello-0.1.0.tar.gz")
    meta.sha256(b, "0123...cdef")

    brew.formula(b) {
        aeb_target("lib/hello/.build.ae")  // what `def install` runs
        binary("hello-world")               // optional override
    }
}
```

```bash
aeb lib/hello/.dist.ae          # emits target/lib/hello/hello-world.rb
```

`meta.url` + `meta.sha256` are required (Homebrew won't accept a
formula without them); `aeb_target` is required (so `def install`
knows which target to build). Class name is auto-derived from the
binary name (hyphens become CamelCase: `hello-world` → `HelloWorld`,
overridable via `class_name(...)`). Custom test assertion via
`test_assertion("...")`.

Because distribution targets are real graph nodes, they compose
with everything else: `aeb --affected --since main` will surface
a `.dist.ae` whose upstream `meta.version` changed; `aeb --graph`
shows them; `aeb --watch` rebuilds them on file edits.

`meta.*` is the source-of-truth — future exporters
(`nix.derivation`, `deb.control`, `pkgsrc.makefile`) will read
the same fields, only adding their packaging-specific overrides
in their own closure.

### Approval checks

Approval checks are non-interactive go/no-go checks against an
external system of record. They do not pause for a human and aeb does
not store approval state. CI/CD remains responsible for human approval
UI; aeb only asks "is this artifact allowed to proceed right now?"

The evidence shape is deliberately common across backends:

```json
{
  "provider": "servicenow",
  "subject": "CHG123456",
  "ok": true,
  "approvals": [
    {"id": "person1", "approved_at": "2026-05-09T10:00:00Z", "status": "approved"},
    {"id": "person2", "approved_at": "2026-05-09T10:05:00Z", "status": "approved"},
    {"id": "person3", "approved_at": "2026-05-09T10:07:00Z", "status": "approved"}
  ],
  "failures": []
}
```

Jira status/label/field checks:

```aether
// apps/api/.dist.ae
import build
import approval
import approval (base_url, issue, require_status, require_label,
                 require_field, token_env)

main() {
    b = build.start()
    build.dep(b, "apps/api/.tests.ae")

    approval.jira(b) {
        base_url("https://jira.example.com")
        issue("REL-1234")
        require_status("Approved")
        require_label("release-approved")
        require_field("Risk", "Accepted")
        token_env("JIRA_TOKEN")        // default if omitted
    }
}
```

At runtime the builder:

- reads the token from the named environment variable
- fetches `/rest/api/2/issue/<issue>` with `curl`
- checks issue status, labels, and requested fields
- writes evidence JSON to `target/<module>/jira-approval.json`
- fails the target if any requirement is missing

Optional setters:

- `evidence("path/to/evidence.json")` — override the evidence path.
- `timeout("30")` — curl max-time in seconds.

Use Jira field IDs such as `customfield_12345` for custom fields when
Jira's REST payload does not expose a friendly field name.

For systems that expose approval rows, use the common approval grammar:

```aether
approval.servicenow(b) {
    base_url("https://instance.service-now.com")
    issue("CHG123456")
    require_approver("person1")
    require_approver("person2")
    require_approver("person3")
    approval_status("approved")
    token_env("SERVICENOW_TOKEN")
}
```

The path setters map native JSON to normalized evidence:

```aether
approval.http(b) {
    url("https://release.example.com/api/approval/release-1")
    subject("release-1")
    bearer_env("RELEASE_TOKEN")
    require_json("change.status", "approved")
    approvals_path("approvals")
    approver_id_path("id")
    approved_at_path("approved_at")
    approval_status_path("status")
    approval_status("approved")
    require_approver("person1")
    require_approver("person2")
    require_approver("person3")
}
```

Backend entry points:

- `approval.jira(b)` — Jira/Jira Service Management issue checks.
- `approval.servicenow(b)` — ServiceNow approval rows for a change.
- `approval.github(b)` — GitHub approval JSON via `url(...)`, or
  environment metadata via `owner(...)`, `repo(...)`, `environment(...)`.
- `approval.gitlab(b)` — GitLab deployment approvals via `url(...)`, or
  `project(...)` + `deployment(...)`.
- `approval.azure_devops(b)` — Azure DevOps checks/approvals endpoint
  via `url(...)`.
- `approval.http(b)` — generic bearer-token JSON endpoint.
- `approval.command(b)` — command prints JSON to stdout, then aeb
  verifies the same paths/approvers:

  ```aether
approval.command(b) {
    subject_env("CHANGE_ID")
    run("scripts/check-release-approval.sh")
    arg_env("CHANGE_ID")
    approvals_path("approvals")
    approver_id_path("id")
    approved_at_path("approved_at")
    require_approver("person1")
    require_approver("person2")
    require_approver("person3")
  }
  ```

CI systems usually provide the change/release identifier as a job
parameter. Jenkins, TeamCity, GitHub Actions, or GitLab can export
`CHANGE_ID=CHG123456`; aeb reads it through `subject_env(...)`,
`issue_env(...)`, `url_env(...)`, or passes it to local scripts with
`arg_env(...)`.

Approval scripts can also emit a plain-text attestation claim and let
aeb normalize, hash, and verify it against a Live Verify-style endpoint:

```aether
approval.attestation(b) {
    subject_env("CHANGE_ID")
    attestation_command("scripts/approval-attestation.sh \"$CHANGE_ID\"")
    verify_via("https://verify.example.com/c")
}
```

The attestation claim is ordinary text containing the release/change
number, approver IDs, approval timestamps, and any other audit facts:

```text
Release: R-2026-05-09
Change: CHG123456
person1: approved at 2026-05-09T10:00:00Z
person2: approved at 2026-05-09T10:05:00Z
person3: approved at 2026-05-09T10:07:00Z
```

aeb canonicalizes the text (line endings, trailing whitespace, final
newline), computes SHA-256 with `std.cryptography`, verifies
`verify_via/<hash>` with `curl`, and writes evidence containing the
canonical claim, hash, and verify URL. Future systems of record can
emit this canonical approval claim directly; current firms can bridge
through scripts.

## Dependencies

Every dependency — local module, third-party library, Maven coordinate, npm
package, NuGet package, Cargo crate, or Python wheel — is declared with a
single `build.dep()` call. The form of the argument distinguishes them:

```aether
// Local module (reference the dep module's .build.ae file)
build.dep(b, "java/components/vowelbase/.build.ae")

// Vendored / registry third-party (reference its .{name}.jar.ae etc.)
build.dep(b, "libs/java/junit/.junit.jar.ae")
build.dep(b, "libs/rust/registry/vendor/jni/.jni.crate.ae")
build.dep(b, "libs/javascript/mocha/.mocha.npm.ae")
build.dep(b, "libs/dotnet/Shouldly/.Shouldly.nupkg.ae")
build.dep(b, "libs/python/pytest/.pytest.whl.ae")

// Maven coordinate (colon-separated; version from BOM if omitted)
build.dep(b, "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa")
build.dep(b, "com.github.javafaker:javafaker:1.0.2")
```

All of these lines are greppable — the build graph is extracted by
scanning source files, not by compiling them. Same contract as Bazel's
`BUILD` files.

### Third-party dep files: `.ae-as-dep`

Rather than a dozen bespoke helpers (`build.npm_dep`, `build.cargo_dep`,
`build.lib`, …), each third-party dep is its own `.ae` file that registers
its contribution via a language-SDK builder. Examples:

```aether
// libs/java/junit/.junit.jar.ae — vendored jar
main() {
    b = build.start()
    java.jar_vendored(b, "libs/java/junit/junit.jar")
}
```

```aether
// libs/rust/registry/vendor/jni/.jni.crate.ae — registry Rust crate
main() {
    b = build.start()
    rust.crate_registry(b, "jni~0.21.1")
}
```

```aether
// libs/python/pytest/.pytest.whl.ae — pypi wheel
main() {
    b = build.start()
    python.wheel_registry(b, "pytest~")
}
```

Each SDK has symmetric `X_vendored` / `X_registry` builders:

| Language | Vendored              | Registry / fetched     |
|----------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Java     | `java.jar_vendored`   | `java.jar_registry`    |
| Rust     | `rust.crate_vendored` | `rust.crate_registry`  |
| TS       | `ts.npm_vendored`     | `ts.npm_registry`      |
| .NET     | `dotnet.nuget_vendored` | `dotnet.nuget_registry` |
| Python   | `python.wheel_vendored` | `python.wheel_registry` |

Consumers don't care which — they just `build.dep(b, "libs/.../.foo.bar.ae")`.

## Maven / BOM support

A `.bom.ae` file at the repo root declares Maven BOMs and extra repos:

```aether
// spring-boot.bom.ae
maven_bom("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies:4.0.4")
```

Modules load it via `load_bom_file(b, "../../spring-boot.bom.ae")`, then
use `build.dep(b, "group:artifact")` with version omitted — the BOM
supplies it. Resolution is performed by `tools/aeb-resolve.jar`, which
wraps the Maven Resolver API and caches to `~/.aeb/repo`.

## Cross-language dependencies

Modules in different languages can depend on each other:

```aether
build.dep(b, "rust/components/vowelbase/.build.ae")    // Java → Rust (JNI .so)
build.dep(b, "kotlin/components/sonorants/.build.ae")  // Java → Kotlin (JVM classpath)
build.dep(b, "go/components/nasal/.build.ae")          // Java → Go (shared library)
```

Each SDK writes artifact metadata to `target/<module>/`:

- `jvm_classpath_deps_including_transitive`
- `rust_path_deps_including_transitive` / `rust_registry_deps_including_transitive`
- `npm_deps_including_transitive` / `npm_registry_deps_including_transitive`
- `dotnet_nuget_deps_including_transitive`
- `python_pypi_deps_including_transitive` / `python_vendored_wheels_including_transitive`
- `ldlibdeps` / `shared_library_deps` (for JNI-style linking)

Downstream SDKs read these files to assemble classpaths, library paths,
Cargo.toml `[dependencies]`, `<PackageReference>`s, `pyproject.toml`
`[project.dependencies]`, and `tsconfig` path mappings.

Working cross-language chains include Java→Rust (JNI), Java→Kotlin,
Java→Go, TypeScript→Go, C#→Rust, Python→Rust (ctypes).

## Incremental builds

SDK builders check source file timestamps against a per-module timestamp
file before doing work. Unchanged modules are skipped at the compile
step; tests always re-run.

## Project layout

`aeb` itself is a ~36-line bash trampoline. It picks up `AETHER`,
`AEB_HOME`, and the working directory, optionally exports a Podman
socket, and dispatches `--init` / `gcheckout` / normal builds to the
matching Aether-language tool under `tools/`. Everything else —
argument parsing, scan/target discovery, dep extraction, topo sort,
per-file compile, orchestrator generation, gcc link, exec — runs in
Aether.

## Example repo

[google-monorepo-sim](https://github.com/paul-hammant/google-monorepo-sim)
— a simulated Google-style monorepo with Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust, C#,
TypeScript, and Python modules, cross-language FFI, JNI, and per-language
third-party deps. Everything builds and tests from a single `aeb`
invocation.

## Unit tests (`tests/`)

Command-string builder tests for every SDK — `javac_cmd()`, `cargo_build_cmd()`,
`go_build_cmd()`, `kotlinc_cmd()`, `junit_cmd()`, `lxc_cmd()`,
`image_build_cmd()`, `dockerfile_content()`. Each test constructs a config
map and asserts the generated command string matches expectations. No
external tools needed — pure string-builder testing.

Run locally on macOS or Linux:

```bash
./tests/run.sh              # all tests
./tests/run.sh cargo        # pattern filter — runs test_cargo_cmd only
AETHER=/path/to/ae ./tests/run.sh   # override ae binary
```

Output classifies each test as `BUILD OK / RUN PASS`, `BUILD FAIL`, or
`RUN FAIL`, so it's obvious whether a failure is a regression in aeb
or an upstream Aether compiler issue. Exits non-zero on any failure.

## Integration tests (`itests/`)

Real-world open-source projects converted from their native build systems
to aeb. Upstream sources are fetched via `itests/fetch-upstream.sh`
and not committed — only the `.build.ae`, `.tests.ae`, `.dist.ae`,
`.bom.ae`, and migration-status docs are tracked. Some repositories are
pinned to a specific commit to avoid source drift against unreleased
upstream dependencies.

### spring-data-examples (Maven → aeb)

Source: [spring-projects/spring-data-examples](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples)
(pinned to commit `cd0d2b36`)

~90 leaf modules across JPA, MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, JDBC, R2DBC, REST,
Web, and multi-store scenarios. Replaces 107 `pom.xml` files. Uses
`java.javac(b)` + `java.junit5(b)` with a Spring Boot BOM for version
management, TestContainers for integration tests (Podman-compatible).

### nx-examples (Nx → aeb)

Source: [nrwl/nx-examples](https://github.com/nrwl/nx-examples)

13 TypeScript modules — Angular 21 (ngc), React 18 (tsc), shared
libraries, Web Components. Uses `ts.tsc` / `angular.ngc` / `jest.test`.
npm deps resolved via pnpm.

### clojure-multiproject-example (deps.edn → aeb)

Source: [adityaathalye/clojure-multiproject-example](https://github.com/adityaathalye/clojure-multiproject-example)

6 Clojure modules — shared library (grugstack), 4 Ring/Jetty/SQLite web
apps, 1 stub. Replaces `deps.edn` aliases and `build/build.clj`
orchestration. Clojure's source-path classpath model is chained
transitively via a `clojure_src_path` artifact.

### scala-cli-multi-module-demo (scala-cli → aeb)

Source: [VirtusLab/scala-cli-multi-module-demo](https://github.com/VirtusLab/scala-cli-multi-module-demo)

3 Scala 3 modules — shared library + 2 apps. The Scala 3 compiler is
invoked directly (`java -cp dotty.tools.dotc.Main`), same as javac. No
scala-cli, Bloop, Coursier, or sbt — `aeb-resolve.jar` + `java` replaces
the entire stack.

### dotnet-architecture-eShopOnWeb (.NET solution → aeb)

Source: [dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb)

10 .NET projects — ASP.NET Core MVC, Blazor WASM, REST API, EF Core,
xUnit. Upgraded from .NET 8 to .NET 10. aeb **generates**
`.{name}.generated.csproj` files from `.build.ae` declarations — NuGet
via `dotnet.nuget_registry`, project refs via `build.dep()`.

### fyne-io/fyne (Go workspace → aeb)

Source: [fyne-io/fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne)

Multi-module Go workspace. Uses `go.go_build` / `go.go_test`.

### Oxen-AI/Oxen (Rust workspace → aeb)

Source: [Oxen-AI/Oxen](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen)

Large Rust workspace; exercises `rust.cargo_workspace` and
`rust.cargo_crate`, with `Cargo.toml` generation for both the workspace
root and every member crate. `crate_registry` handles dozens of
dependencies with feature flags.

### python-monorepo-demo (Pants → aeb)

Source: [SystemCraftsman/pants-python-monorepo-demo](https://github.com/SystemCraftsman/pants-python-monorepo-demo)

A small Python monorepo. Uses `python.install` / `python.pytest` with
`.whl.ae` dep files (`python.wheel_registry` / `wheel_vendored`).
`python.package(b)` generates `pyproject.toml` at build time — no
hand-written packaging metadata.

### mrhdias_rust_store (Tokio → aeb)

Source: [mrhdias/store](https://github.com/mrhdias/store)

A small Tokio/axum Rust project. Single-crate `Cargo.toml` generation.

## Requirements

- [Aether](https://github.com/AetherLang/aether) compiler (`ae`) —
  recent enough to include the `hoist_loop_vars` and parameter-redeclare
  fixes in `codegen/`.
- Language toolchains for whatever you build: `javac`, `kotlinc`, `go`,
  `cargo`, `tsc`/`node`, `scala` (Scala 3 compiler jar), `clojure`,
  `dotnet` SDK, `python3`, `pnpm`.
- For Java projects with Maven deps: build the resolver jar once —

### macOS notes

`aeb` itself works on macOS — the bash trampoline uses only POSIX-level
features and the orchestration has been ported to Aether, so nothing in
the runner path requires GNU bash or GNU coreutils. You can run
`./tests/run.sh` (the unit-test runner) straight from a vanilla macOS
install.

There is one known limitation for full multi-module builds: the link
step in `tools/aeb-link.ae` passes `-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition`,
which is GNU ld only. Apple's ld64 rejects it, and a full `./aeb` run
that links more than a handful of modules will fail with duplicate
symbol errors until that flag is platform-gated or the underlying
duplicate-symbol emission is fixed upstream in the Aether compiler.
See `TODO.md` for tracking.

Container-related SDKs also have reduced functionality on macOS:
Docker Desktop or Podman is required for image builds, and LXC is
Linux-only. All other SDKs (Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust, TypeScript, Scala,
Clojure, .NET) work identically to Linux.

  ```bash
  mvn -f tools/resolver/pom.xml package
  mv tools/resolver/target/aeb-resolve-1.0.0.jar tools/aeb-resolve.jar
  rm -rf tools/resolver/target
  ```
- For TestContainers-based tests: Docker or Podman. aeb auto-detects the
  user-level Podman socket.
